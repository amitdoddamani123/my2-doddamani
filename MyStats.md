I was born and grew up in India, in a small farm village that is major producer of cotton. So, most of the time I spent was in fields, looking after and helping my family in fields. It helped me to understand the techniques, discipline and the importance of crops and cultivating them.<br>
This embedded me to join agriculture in my high school and then graduate with the diploma in agriculture sciences.
